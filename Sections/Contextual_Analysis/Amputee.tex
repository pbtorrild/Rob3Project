\chapter{Amputees}\label{ch:Amputee}

The relevance of the amputees daily life and struggles, is correlated to the improvements that might be discovered towards the prosthesis.\\

\section{Amputee Obstacles}

Severe amputees and limb loss creates obstacles on a daily basis. This is some of the obstacles for upper limb amputees who uses prothesese:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Skin Care
    \item Repetitive Strain
    \item Weight Control
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Skin care:}

The residual limb is enclosed in the prosthesis which is sealed airtight around the limb. This leads to sweat not being able to evaporate.\\
Exposing the limb to such components will result in blisters and irritated skin around the residual limb\cite{SkinCare}.\\

\textbf{Repetitive Strain:}\\
Physical overloads of the joint of the prosthetic fitting is another well-known issue. Vibrations, rotations and mechanical pressures can amplify the pain.\\
Amputees is more exposed to these strains, in fact 3 papers states that half of the people with prosthesis tested feels pain while operating repetitive tasks, while people with limbs reports that, only 10 percent feels the pain \cite{StrainInjuries}.\\
\clearpage

\textbf{Weight Control:}\\

Applying the prosthesis a weight to height ratio cannot be considered, since the prosthesis weighs less than a human limb.\\
Conserving the weight and height the amputee had when the prosthesis was attached, is the main goal. When weight is added it can become uncomfortable to wear the artificial limb, and a new socket will be needed \cite{weightControl}.

\section{Muscle Failures}
Due to a wide range of differences in circumstances leading to a lack of limbs, it is assumed that in our case that the muscles from the shoulder joint and up is intact \discuss{add reason for this being possible}

\discuss{Cant find anything on muscle failures due to amputation}

\subsection{muscles around a severed arm (what mucles can we use)}
    To begin with we need to define our patient.\\
    -   where is the arm amputated (below/above albow/shoulder)\\
