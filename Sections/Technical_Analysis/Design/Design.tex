\section{Data flow}
The figure below shows the data flow of the solution presented in this chapter. A single line in the arrow signifies that data is flowing one way and a double line means that information is both being sent and received.
\input{Figures/TikzFigures/DataFlow.tex}
\subsection{Measuring unit}
On the user, a grey measuring box is mounted. This box consists of two Sparkfun Muscle Sensor Platinum V3.3 EMG sensors, one Polulo 3-Axis Accelerometer, a battery and an XBee S1 radio module.
\subsubsection{Sparkfun EMG sensors}
The sensor measures raw EMG, however, this is not what is received by the rest of the system. First, the raw data is sent through a circuit that rectifies the raw EMG this means taking the root square of the input in order only to have positive data. After this, a small number of data points is then summed and averaged to smooth the data out in the smooth circuit. After the rectification and smoothing the data is sent to the XBee. A full schematic of the EMG sensors can be seen in Appendix \ref{app:EMGsensor}
\subsubsection{Polulo Accelerometer}
This is a simple 3-axis accelerometer providing further 3 channels of input into the measuring box. 
\subsubsection{Wireless transition with Xbee}\label{XbeeExplan}
The XBee S1 radio module is the foundation of the wireless transmission of data in this solution. It has a frequency of $100Hz$ and sends a frame on every sample which is created every $0.10s$ and the frame consists of 24 bytes. The structure of the 24 bytes can be seen below in figure \ref{fig:XbeeFrame}
\input{Figures/TikzFigures/XbeeFrame.tex}\label{XbeeDataStruct}
The first is the header-byte, this determines the start of a new frame, after that there is the information on the length of the frame. This checks if all 24 bytes are in the frame. Afterwards, there is information on the XBee module followed by data gathered from the sensors and is ended by the CheckSum that checks if the data is transferred correctly.
\subsection{Main Control PC}
The Main Control PC (MCP) receive information from the measuring unit and the robot. The measuring unit data is converted into an output that is readable to the robot.
\subsubsection{Dynamixel Protocol 2.0}
The Dynamixel Servos is communicated with via the Dynamixel Protocol 2.0.
The communication of the Dynamixelmotors on the robot arm has is a modular and daisy-chained system that supports data packet control. The packets consist of two parts. An instructional packet is sent to the motors, and a status packet is received from the motors. 

\missingfigure{CAN BE SEEN HERE \label{fig:DynamixelStructure} \url{http://www.robotis.us/product_images/uploaded_images/dynamixel-03-2012.jpg}}

As seen in figure \ref{fig:DynamixelStructure} above is the data structure on the Dynamixel servos. A header determining the start off the packet and direction information, and a payload where most of the information is stored. 
\paragraph{The instructional packet} has the basic structure seen the the figure bellow:
\input{Figures/TikzFigures/InstructPAcket.tex}
First, the instructional packet has a header field, which indicates the start of the packet. Then there is a reserved slot with the value $0x00$, note that $0xFD$ cannot be used.  The Packet ID, refers to the ID of the device that receives and process the sent data. In the next field information on the packet length is provided and after this is the instruction field. In this field, the purpose of the packet is defined. A list of input can be seen in table \ref{tab:Instruct}.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{ | P{1.5cm} || P{2cm}|| P{9cm} |  }
 \hline
 \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Instruction} & \textbf{Describtion} \\
 \hline
 $0x01$ & Ping & Instruction that checks whether the Packet has arrived to a device with the same ID as Packet ID\\\hline
 $0x02$ & Read & Instruction to read data from the Device\\\hline
 $0x03$ & Write & Instruction to write data on the Device\\\hline
 $0x04$ & Reg Write & Instruction that registers the Instruction Packet to a standby status; Packet is later executed through the Action command\\\hline
  $0x05$ & Action & Instruction that executes the Packet that was registered beforehand using Reg Write\\\hline
  $0x06$ & Factory Reset & 	
Instruction that resets the Control Table to its initial factory default settings\\\hline
$0x08$ & Reboot & Instruction to reboot the Device\\\hline
$0x55$ & Status (Return) & Return Instruction for the Instruction Packet\\\hline
$0x82$ & Sync read & For multiple devices, Instruction to read data from the same Address with the same length at once\\\hline
$0x83$ & Sync Write & For multiple devices, Instruction to write data on the same Address with the same length at once\\\hline
 $0x92$ & Bulk Read & For multiple devices, Instruction to read data from different Addresses with different lengths at once\\\hline
  $0x93$ & Bulk Write & For multiple devices, Instruction to write data on different Addresses with different lengths at once\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Table of instructions Protocol 2.0}
    \label{tab:Instruct}
\end{table}
After the instruction field is the parameter fields. These are helpful data and are dependant on what instruction is in use. After the instruction field is the parameter fields. These are help-data and are dependant on what instruction is in use. Ultimately, is the 16 bit CRC which checks if the packet has been damaged and lost data.  
\\
\paragraph{The status packet} has the basic structure seen the the figure bellow:
\input{Figures/TikzFigures/StatusPacket.tex}
As you can see from the only difference from the structure of the instruction packet is the error field.
This error field indicates the result of the instruction packet. The error field can be seen in the figure above. 
\input{Figures/TikzFigures/ErrorStruckt.tex}
In bit number 7, the alert changes the value from 0 to 1 if there is a failure on the device. 
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|P{1.5cm}||P{2cm}||P{9cm}|}\hline
       \textbf{Value}  & \textbf{Error} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
        $0x01$ & Result fail &  failed to process the sent Instruction Packet\\ \hline
        $0x02$ & Instruction Error &  undefined Instruction has been used OR Action has been used without Reg Write\\ \hline
        $0x03$ & CRC Error &  CRC of the sent Packet does not match\\ \hline
        $0x04$ & Data range Error &  Data to be written in the corresponding Address is outside the range of the minimum/maximum value\\ \hline
        $0x05$ & Data Length Error &  Attempt to write Data that is shorter than the data length of the corresponding Address\\ \hline
        $0x06$ & Data Limit Error &  Data to be written in the corresponding Address is outside of the Limit value\\ \hline
        
        $0x07$ & 
        Access Error&  Attempt to write a value in an Address that is Read Only or has not been defined OR  attempt to read a value in an Address that is Write Only or has not been defined OR attempt to write a value in the ROM domain while in a state of Torque Enable(ROM Lock)\\ \hline

\paragraph{The Teensy microcontroller} is used as a data bridge between the MCP and the Dynamixel servos.
\subsection{CrustCrawler}
The robotic manipulator used in this project is a CrustCrawler arm consisting of one Dynamixel MX 106 SERVO, two Dynamixel MX 64 SERVO and two MX 28 Servos in the following setup:

\section{Control Systems}
%Intro:
\input{Figures/TikzFigures/OpenClosedLoops.tex}
As seen on the figure \ref{fig:openclose}, open loop, it manages to compute the reference signal and regulate it so that it is equal to the desired output. If a  disturbance were introduced to the open loop system, the system could not adjust for the disturbance and would produce an unrecognisable error.\\
In the closed-loop system/feedback loop we can measure the output error and measure it towards the input and try to eliminate the error of disturbances to make the system linear, and easier to work with, but this is another section that will be covered in \ref{PID}.\\ 
Utilising these control systems can be done by transfer functions. Transfer functions is the Laplace formulae of the control system design.\\

\subsection{The Golden Formula}
\input{Figures/TikzFigures/StandartFromFeedBack.tex}
When working with the standard setup of a feedback loop the use of the Golden Formula can describe the output $C(s)$ depending on the input $R(s)$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GoldenFormula}
    C(s)=\frac{G(s)}{1\mp G(s)\cdot H(s)}\cdot R(s)
\end{equation}
The transfer function given by the Golden Formula, this is what is called the closed-loop transfer function, the product $G(s)\cdot H(s)$ is called the open-loop transfer-function, or loop-gain.



\subsection{Signal analysis}
When working with sinusoidal signals there are terms to describe the signal. Figure \ref{fig:StepRespGraf} illustrates some of these terms graphically on a step response signal.

\begin{figure}[H]
 \centering 
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Figures/StepResponse1.jpg}
    \caption{Figure with using step response signal, terms marked graphically in figure\cite{Risetime76:online}.}
    \label{fig:StepRespGraf}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rise time} refers to the duration it takes for the step response y(t) from 10\% to 90\% of the final steady-state of the response\cite{Risetime76:online}.
    
    \item \textbf{Settling time} is the time it takes for y(t) reach and stay within the steady state, which is  +/- 2\% of $y_{final}$ (the steady state value)\cite{Risetime76:online}.
   
    \item \textbf{Percent overshoot} is the overshoot y(t) reaches relative to the steady state value $y_{final}$\cite{Risetime76:online}.

    \item \textbf{Peak} is highest value y(t) reaches\cite{Risetime76:online}.

    \item \textbf{Peak time} is the time it takes  for y(t) reach its first/maximum value\cite{Risetime76:online}.
