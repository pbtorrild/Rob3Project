\section{User interface}\label{st:Emg}
The user interface (UI) consist of a sEMG sensor array, were provided for this project. A short introduction to this was given in the control systems section \ref{sEMG}. A more detailed description on how to make input control system from the sEMG can be found later in the report.

\paragraph{Electromyography} or EMG as it has been called throughout this project. A muscle is made up of many of these small fibres called myofibril that each produces a difference in the potential, the EMG signal is the sum of all these fibres within one skeletal muscle. This signal needs amplification furthermore the signal has to be processed with the help of mathematical tools that are part of MATLAB in order to create a reliable source of control. The use of EMG is well documented in different articles in the use of a prosthetic arm  \cite{Castellini2009}.

\subsection*{Signal processing}
When the control unit receives the sEMG data, either through a micro controller or a computer that processes the data, the data is the raw input data from the sEMG and cannot be used as an input for a control system. It is therefore clear that there is a need for processing the received data, this can be done through Fourier transform or fast Fourier transform. Here the signal is broken into sinusoid  of the frequencies or as the method, the full wave and root mean square analysis.\\ 

\subsubsection{Filters}
Digital filters is an important part of signal processing. 
These filters removes the noise in the signal depending on what frequencies of the signal that is useful for a robot or radio. A robot needs low frequencies due to it is a mechanical system.\\
Filters are classified as the frequency types it will filter on the signal. Two of the filters, the \textbf{low-pass} and the \textbf{high-pass} describes the filters that let the signal pass above or below a certain cutoff frequency. There is also the band-pass, and the band-stop filter witch let the frequency's in a defined bandwidth pass through or block them respectively.
The most suited filter should be chosen based on analysis of the signal.

\paragraph{Sampling}
Certain precautions needs to be taken when sampling the sEMG signal. according to the \textit{Nyquist theorem} the sampling rate should be at least twice that of the signal frequency in order to insure the sinusoid of the EMG signal can be recreated. If this is not done then the data could be corrupted by the aliasing phenomenon. \cite{Nyquist}

%there are in general two use categorys, \textit{signal separation} and \textit{signal restoration}. \cite{FilterBa67:online}


%\paragraph{Signal separation} as the name implies this category seperates the signal passed through. this is normally used when the signal is contaminated with signal noise or other interference. in praxis an example could be a muscle sensor on the pectoralis major. here the signal might be contaminated with noise from the heart or other muscles. 
%therefore there would be a need to seperate the signals and isolate the wanted muscle signal.\cite{FilterBa67:online}
%\paragraph{signal restoration} this refers to when a signal has been distorted. an example could be an audio recording. after filtering it, the sound quality might improve beyond the original. \cite{FilterBa67:online}

\subsection*{Electronic hardware}
For a signal to be used in a software application there is a need for a way to interpret the signal. In this project the use of an EMG signal requires a hardware part, in this case, it is the muscle sensor from Advanced technology. The muscle sensor measures the signal through the electrodes placed on the use, furthermore, the device amplifies the signal by a gain of 100, it also rectifies the wave signal, which will be described later. Moreover, the EMG sensor smooths the signal and convert it from an analogue signal to a digital signal that can be processed\cite{EMGHARD}.\\
As seen in figure: \ref{fig:GainsEMG}, firstly the gain is decided through resistor R1, the voltage goes through MID and END, which are EMG inputs. The EMG signals then get amplified across the operational amplifier(OP AMP).\\

\end{multicols}

\paragraph{Full wave}
rectifying can be done by hardware or software. The software approach can be done simply by taking the absolute value \cite{RMS} of the input data, in this case the hardware rectify the wave. Since the signal is an alternating waveform the signal is now only represented as positive numbers. Furthermore, the negative part of the data-set is conserved by squaring the value. This is important for the next step in analysing the data signal, and the root mean square process.\\
The schematics of rectifying the signal can be seen in \ref{fig:rect}, has a input from the latest schematic "Measure", where it polarises the input through a capacitor, and send the polarized signal through a 150k resistor. The signal is then sent through a serial connection, connected with junctions which includes known OP AMP's and ground inputs. The signal is now rectified.\\

\paragraph{Root mean square} or RMS is a solution made in order to get an average over time from a sinusoid waveform. It needs the wave form described in the full wave, this is referring to the squared part of RMS, so the means of the EMG signal can be evaluated, refraining from the rectifying of the squared part gets the mean of zero\cite{RMS}. After processing the signal it
an used as an implementation for a control signal.\\
The next step of schematics is as seen in \ref{fig:smooth}, is smoothing out the signal as described above. The rectified signal gets processed in a serial connection with known OP AMP's, resistors and capacitors. When the EMG signal is sent through this part of EMG sensor, the signal is smoothed.\\
The last schematics \ref{fig:finalGain}, with smooth signal as input, it is again put through a OP AMP to get the last gain before the signal is being sent. The gain in this OP AMP is decided through the potentiometer.\\

\subsection*{Muscles around a severed arm}

Due to a wide range of differences in circumstances leading to a lack of limbs, it is assumed that in the case of this shoulder disarticulation, that there is no abnormal damages to the muscles from the shoulder joint and up making them intact.\\
No amputee is a like and especially in the case of how much different muscles contracted, 
%so in cases of an EMG signal (See Section\ref{sEMG}) to control the prostheses, 
the best measuring points is fund in collaboration with patient and the prosthetist.\\ 
For a person with a shoulder disarticulation two major muscles to take note of is the Pectoralis major also known as the breast muscle see figure \ref{fig:Pectoralis major} and the Trapezius muscle located from the top of the shoulder to the upper upper back see figure \ref{fig:Trapezius}. These are easy to receive readings on and as such would be able to be used to control a prostheses.\\
