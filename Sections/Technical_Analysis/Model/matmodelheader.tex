\chapter{Mathematical Model}\label{ch:MatematicalModel}
In this chapter different mathematical models of the CrustCrawler is introduced, which is by definition:\\\\
\textit{\textbf{"a representation in mathematical terms of the behavior of real devices and objects"}}
\\\\
By equating these models a deeper understanding on the object is given.\\
The CrustCrawler's physical setup is as the following.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Distance from table to base plate 170mm
    \item Length L1 = 70mm  this is measured from the base plate to centre of shoulder 2.
    \item Length L2 = 210mm this is measured between centre of shoulder 2 and the elbow joints.
    \item Length L3 = 219mm this is measured from elbow joint to the middle of the end-effector.
    
    \item Mass Link  L2 = 36.8g
    \item Mass Link  L3 = 22.7g 
    
    
    \item Mass Servo L1 = 135g
    \item Mass Servo L2 = 153g
    \item Mass Servo L3 = 135g
\end{itemize}

This physcial setup will influence the dynamics as well as the kinematics.
