\chapter{Matematical Model}\label{ch:MatematicalModel}
In this chapter different mathematical models of the crustcrawler, these will provide a foundation for the implementation section. These models will be used to describe the movement and dynamics.\\
The crustcrawlers physical setup is as the following.
\begin{itemize}
    \item distance from table to base plate 170mm
    \item Length L1 = 70mm  this is measured from the base plate to centre of shoulder 2.
    \item Length L2 = 210mm this is measured between centre of shoulder 2 and the elbow joints.
    \item Length L3 = 219mm this is measured from elbow joint to the middle of the end-effector.
    \item Mass L1 = 
    \item Mass L2 =
    \item Mass L3 =
\end{itemize}

This physcial setup will influence the dynamics as well as the kinematics. A description in the form of Denavit Hartenberg is the appendix\ref{st:Denavit}.
